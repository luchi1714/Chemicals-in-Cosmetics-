Problem Understanding 

Cosmetics can be defined as products used to enhance or change the appearance of the face, fragrance or the texture of the body. They are generally mixtures of chemical compounds derived from natural,  synthetic or artificial sources[1].The main purpose these chemicals serve  in cosmetics include but are not limited to fragrances, emulsifiers, thickeners , moisturizers etc. Although currently we donâ€™t have evidence on proving the long term carcinogenic risks associated with some of these ingredients, some of them have been proven to have caused allergic reaction in individuals.

with the rise of knowledge of the potential health risks linked to each of these chemicals, now more than ever the average cosmetics consumer demands stricter regulatory measures and transparency regarding the composition of these products.  
In light of this need, this study aims to understand chemical trends in various categories of cosmetics. To facilitate consumers make decisions this study also aims to find an underlying  basis to compare the safeness of one brand to another . In order to do this this study will aims  to answer the following questions:
1.	Which brands are the safest based on recall frequency
2.	Which companies offer the most consumer choice  
3.	Can we find an underlying trend by  which data can be grouped
